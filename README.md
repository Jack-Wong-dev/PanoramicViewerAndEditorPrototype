# PanoramicViewerPrototype

## Introduction
This is a WIP project that turns equirectangular images (e.g photosphere) into panoramic viewing experiences.  
The objective of this project is to create the editing tools to make a DIY interactive panoramas experience.

This project serves as the R&D of the virtual tour and editor experience of my capstone team's project [Truview](https://github.com/NormanLiana/TruView)

## Usage
This project provides example photosphere images taken with Google's Street View camera.
You can view an example tour using these images, or use the images to create an example tour.

## Virtual Tour
Users can interact with the tour by panning around tapping on interactive floating circles to go other destinations.
Other interactions include pinch to zoom, and the option to use motion controls to view the tour.

## Tour Editor
Users can replicate the example tour by using the tools provided by the floating action button/menu located on the lower 
right corner of the screen.
